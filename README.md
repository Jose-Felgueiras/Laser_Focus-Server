# Laser_Focus Server
 Dedicated server for laser focus

Created using a tutorial from Tom Weiland

My first multiplayer project

This server sends TCP data on a specified port using packets.
To connect it to the internet you will probably have to port forward you ip address, if you are connected to a router.

It has the hability to communicate with a database and connected clientes.

Only works for the Laser Focus game also on my github

Would love to learn more about security as, currently, the only way to connect to it is by sharing your public IP.
